        //Write a program that safely compares floating-point numbers(double) with precision eps = 0.000001.
        //Note that we cannot directly compare two floating-point numbers a and b by using (a == b) because of the nature of the floating-point arithmetic.
        //Therefore, we assume two numbers are equal if they are more close to each other than some fixed constant eps.
        //You will receive two lines, each containing a floating - point number.Your task is to compare the values of the two numbers.
        //Examples
        //Number a      Number b    Equal(with precision eps = 0.000001)    Explanation
