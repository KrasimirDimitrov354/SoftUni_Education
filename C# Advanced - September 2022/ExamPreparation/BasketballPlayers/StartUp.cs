    //Basketball Players
    //One of your best friends is the manager of the National Amateur Basketball League. He asked you to create a program which will help him manage the players and their teams.
    //Your task is to create a catalog of teams containing information for various basketball players.
    //
    //You are given a class Player, create the following properties:
    //  •	Name: string
    //  •	Position: string
    //  •	Rating: double
    //  •	Games: int
    //  •	Retired: boolean – false by default
    //
    //The class constructor should receive(name, position, rating, games).
    //
    //The class should also have a method:
    //  •	Override the ToString() method in the format:
    //      "-Player: {name}
    //       --Position: {position}
    //       --Rating: {rating}
    //       --Games played: {games}"
    //
    //You are also given a class named Team, that has a collection (players) of type Player.
    //All the entities of the Players collection have the same properties. The Team has also some additional properties:
    //  •	Name: string
    //  •	OpenPositions: int
    //  •	Group: char
    //
    //The constructor of the Team class should receive the name, open positions and group.
    //
    //Implement the following features in the class Team:
    //  •	Getter Count - return the count of the players in the team.
    //
    //  •	string AddPlayer(Player player) – add a player to the team's collection, if there are open positions. Check before adding a player:
    //      o	If the name or position is null or empty, return "Invalid player's information.".
    //      o	If there are no more open positions, return "There are no more open positions.". 
    //      o	If the rating is under 80, return "Invalid player's rating.".
    //      o	Otherwise, return: "Successfully added {playerName} to the team. Remaining open positions: {openPositions}.". Decrease the OpenPositions property of the team.
    //
    //  •	bool RemovePlayer(string name) – remove a player by given name.
    //      o	If such exists, return true;
    //      o Otherwise, return false.
    //
    //  •	int RemovePlayerByPosition(string position) – remove all players by the given position.
    //      o	If such exist(s), return the count of the removed players;
    //      o Otherwise, return 0.
    //
    //  •	Player RetirePlayer(string name) – retire (set his Retired property to true, without removing him from the collection) the player with the given name, if he exists.
    //      As a result, return the player, or null, if he doesn't exist.
    //
    //  •	List<Player> AwardPlayers(int games) – return a list with all players that have participated in the provided count of games or more.
    //
    //  •	Report() – return a string with information about the team and players who are not retired, in the following format:	
    //      "Active players competing for Team {team} from Group {group}:
    //       {Player1}
    //       {Player2}
    //       {…}"
    //
    //Constraints
    //  •	The names of the players will be always unique.
    //  •	You will always have a player added before receiving methods manipulating the teams' players.
